  <h2>🐾 Meet 淘淘 (Tau Tau)</h2>
  <p>
    This page is for my lovely dog. She’s a cheerful and affectionate <strong>Shiba Inu</strong>, 
    always wearing a warm and sweet smile. Her name is <strong>淘淘</strong>, pronounced just like the 
    mathematical symbol <em>ττ (tau tau)</em>, which also means <em>“naughty”</em> in Chinese — 
    a name that suits her perfectly!
  </p>
  <p>
    淘淘 is already <strong>4 years old</strong>, and I truly believe she’ll stay happy, healthy, and just the right 
    amount of mischievous forever and ever.
