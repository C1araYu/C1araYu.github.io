Hi! I'm Kuai. My name means happiness and speed in Chinese, two things I bring to both my research and my daily life. I'm a second year master student in Computer Science from [Columbia Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/). I'm very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/) in [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I also work as a research assistant with [Prof. Huan Zhang](https://huan-zhang.com/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Also, I am supervised by [Prof. Hao Wang](https://intellisys.haow.us/haowang/) in [Intellisys Lab](https://intellisys.haow.us/) from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/). 

My research interests include Web Agents, Trustworthy ML, and Computer Vison.

**I am looking for a PhD position in Fall 2026!!**


## Publications
### How do Visual Attributes Influence Web Agents? A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors
**Kuai Yu**, Naicheng Yu, Han Wang, Rui Yang, Huan Zhang

*Under Review*
**[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21961)**

We propose VAF, a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically generates CSS-based webpage variants to analyze how visual design elements such as color, layout, and typography influence web agents’ decision-making, revealing human-like visual biases and vulnerabilities in multimodal web agents.

### LyTimeT: Towards Robust and Interpretable State-Variable Discovery

**Kuai Yu**, Crystal Su, Xiang Liu, Judah Goldfeder, Mingyuan Shao, Hod Lipson

*2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP26)*  
**[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19716)**

We propose LyTimeT, a vision-transformer-based framework that integrates Lyapunov-theoretic regularization with time-series modeling to discover interpretable and robust state variables from visual dynamical systems, enabling stable trajectory prediction and physically consistent variable extraction across diverse temporal domains.

### POLAR: Policy-based Layerwise Reinforcement Method for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning  

**Kuai Yu**, Xiaoyu Wu, Peishen Yan, Yang Hua, Hao Wang, Tao Song, Linshan Jiang, Haibing Guan  

*Under Review*  
**[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19056)**

We propose POLAR, a reinforcement learning-based method that formulates layer-wise selection for efficient and stealthy backdoor attacks in federated learning. POLAR dynamically adapts to defenses and balances attack success rate with stealthiness.

### W3FedPOSE: A Practical WEB3.0-Based Federated Learning Framework with Privacy, Ownership, Security, and Efficiency  

Peishen Yan, **Kuai Yu**, Yaozhi Zhang, Yulin Sun, Shuang Liang, Yang Hua, Tao Song, Linshan Jiang, Ningxin Hu, Mohammad Reza Haghighat, Bingsheng He, Haibing Guan  

*Under Review*  

We present W3FedPOSE, a practical federated learning framework that integrates Web3.0 technologies. It leverages blockchain and smart contracts for secure data ownership and access control, while introducing an explainable, incentive-driven algorithm for efficient and trustworthy collaboration.
